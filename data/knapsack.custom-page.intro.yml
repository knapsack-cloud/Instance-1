        ## Welcome


        Have a look around this example Knapsack instance. It comes with a
        couple basic components, design tokens and a multi-page prototype
        concept.


        ### Things To Do


        If you login, you can experiment with editing content, creating pattern
        examples and embedding resources via content blocks.


        Try editing design tokens in the `./src/design-tokens` folder, or
        experiment with modifying or styling the components in the
        `src/components` folder.


        The components available out of the box are:
