        ## Welcome


        This Knapsack sandbox is all yours. Use it to get familiar with the
        experience of working with Knapsack in your digital production workflow.


        This instance is connected to a basic GitHub repo that the Knapsack team
        set up and have granted you (or your team) access to. It comes with a
        few basic patterns, some design tokens and a[ page prototype
        concept](/instance-1/latest/pattern/page-flow-example?subPageId=Overview).
        Your Engineers can copy the repo down and work with Knapsack locally to
        explore how it connects to your system code. 


        If you become interested in exploring further, get in touch with the
        Knapsack team and we'll help them hook things up your team's own repo(s)
        so you can see and work with your own patterns and tokens.


        ### Things To Do


        Once you login, you can experiment with editing content, creating
        pattern examples and embedding resources via content blocks. Try adding
        new pages or patterns, modifying statuses and exploring ways to support
        or improve your workflows when building with a design system.


        As you explore Patterns and Design Tokens pages, you'll see how Knapsack
        renders your system source code in our documentation and playgrounds.
        Try editing tokens in the `./src/design-tokens` folder, or experiment
        with modifying or styling the Patterns in the `src/components` folder to
        see how changes reflect in Knapsack.


        The Patterns available out of the box are presented below.
